Title:       Linear Algebra Solver
Authors:     Jerel Miller, Ben Makuh, Eric List
Description: This application trivializes many common linear algebra
             operations that can be time consuming or simply irritating
             to do by hand.  In particular, this application supports the
             following functions:

             1. Calculating the determinant of a 2x2 or 3x3 matrix
             2. Adding two matricies together
             3. Subtracting one matrix from another
             4. Multiplying two matricies together
             5. Multiplying a matrix by a scalar

             While there are other matrix operations that one could perform,
             these are the most common and will substantially ease the amount
             of effort one must exert in a linear algebra course.
